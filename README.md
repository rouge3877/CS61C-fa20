# CS 61C: Great Ideas in Computer Architecture

* This repository records the self-study materials and assignments for the **CS 61C**. I use the [2020 summer](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61c/su20/) version and [2020 fall](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61c/fa20/) version because it open-sourced the lecture videos.

* This repository refers to https://github.com/PKUFlyingPig/CS61C-summer20. 

* I need to first declare that although the repository's name is CS61C-su20, Most of the [projects](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61c/fa20/#projects) I have worked comes from fa2020. 

* In addition, except lab#01 and lab#02,  all labs are based on [fa20](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61c/fa20/#labs)

* In addition, except Discussion#01 and Discussion#02,  all Discussions are based on [fa20](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61c/fa20/#discussions)
